title: Setting up your development environment

Overview

The following will assist you in setting up your local machine to enable you to work on our repos hosted on GitHub.


The Silver Bullet Method&trade;

Much like many things in this life, such process doesn't exist -- yet.


Manual Installation
---

Depending on your system your mileage may vary. Our stack primarily includes: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/). So at a high level, if you can get those installed, you're good to go.

Let's get started!

*****

<h1 id="mac"><a href="/set-up#mac">Mac</a></h1>

_These steps are for OS X 10.8+._

#### System Update

Seriously. First thing you need to do if you haven't yet. Apple Icon > Software Update

#### Command Line Tools

To get our favorite package manager, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), we need to first grab Command Line Tools for Xcode. You'll need to [download it from Apple's Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/downloads). Make an account, navigate over to the latest version of the Command Line Tools for your OS. Install.

#### Homebrew

Once you've got CLT installed, jump into your Terminal (Applications » Utilities » Terminal), and copy paste the following:

```bash
ruby <(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)

# Once it's done, add Homebrew's binary path to the front of the $PATH

echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Check to see if everything is configured properly:

```bash
brew doctor
```

To get the latest forumale, run:

```bash
brew update
```

#### Git

Git is an integral component of our workflow. So let's get it STAT. To install, simply run:

```bash
brew install git
```

Once that's done, verify the installation

```bash
git --version
```

Also, running `which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.

#### Ruby

OS X comes with Ruby but that's some system level voodoo you don't want to mess with so we'll be using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build) to install and manage our Ruby environment.

We'll install both using Homebrew (it's the best, isn't it?) and then add a line to our `~/.bash_profile` and reload our terminal session.

```bash
brew install rbenv ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

`rbenv` and `ruby-build` allows us to install different version of Ruby and specify which version to use on a per-project basis.

Let's install the latest stable version of Ruby which at the time of writing is `2.0.0-p247`. You can check all available version over at the [Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) or just run `rbenv install --list`.

```bash
rbenv install 2.0.0-p247
rbenv rehash
```

Set `2.0.0-p247` as the version to use globally so we can make use of it in our terminal.

```bash
rbenv global 2.0.0-p247
```

#### Bundler

Bundler is a nice little dealio that mangages an application's dependencies.

You should be running `Ruby 2.0.0-p247`.

```bash
gem install bundler
rbenv rehash
```

We need to configure Bundler to install gems relative to our projects instead of globally.

```bash
mkdir ~/.bundle
touch ~/.bundle/config
echo 'BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle' >> ~/.bundle/config
```

Save some time and skip rdoc generation.

```bash
echo 'gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri' >> ~/.gemrc
```

### PostgreSQL

Just like Ruby, OS X Lion and Mountain Lion come with PostgreSQL but it's an old version and no good to develop with.

The easiest way to run Postgres on the Mac is using the [app](http://postgresapp.com/). Download, install, and run. It'll chill in your menubar. Alternatively, you can run it without the app, so pull down the latest and greatest using Homebrew.


```bash
brew install postgresql
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8

# Add PostgreSQL to launchctl to let OS X manage the process and start when you login
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
```
Postgres has a slightly longer command as you need to pass in the locations so we'll create an alias to shrink all this down to simply `pg`.

```bash
echo "alias pg='pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log'" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
pg start
# Usage: pg {start|stop|restart|reload|status}
```

For ease, I'd suggest sticking with the app.

### Rails

Ah yes. Finally, the main event. As long as you have Ruby and Bundler going, this step should be a cinch. 

```bash
gem install rails
rbenv rehash
```
This might take a little time, so grab your drink of choice and browse the 'net. Once it's done, check you have Rails by running `rails -v`.

_That about does it for the setting up your Mac for Rails development!_

<h1 id="windows"><a href="/set-up#windows">Windows</a></h1>

Currently, not many in the Ruby / Rails community develop on Windows so documentation is sparse or not properly fleshed out. [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org/en), is a good solution for setting up a development environment. Good luck!

Our suggestion is that you borrow a Macintosh or install Linux on your computer and use the operating system for Rails development.
