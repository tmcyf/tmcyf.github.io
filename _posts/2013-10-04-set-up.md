title: Setting up your development environment

Overview

The following will assist you in setting up your local machine to enable you to work on our repos hosted on GitHub.


The Silver Bullet Method&trade;

Much like many things in this life, such process doesn't exist -- yet.


Manual Installation
---

Depending on your system your mileage may vary. Our stack primarily includes: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/). So at a high level, if you can get those installed, you're good to go.

Let's get started!

*****

<h1 id="mac"><a href="/set-up#mac">Mac</a></h1>

_These steps are for OS X 10.8+._

#### System Update

Seriously. First thing you need to do if you haven't yet. Apple Icon > Software Update

#### Command Line Tools

To get our favorite package manager, [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), we need to first grab Command Line Tools for Xcode. You'll need to [download it from Apple's Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/downloads). Make an account, navigate over to the latest version of the Command Line Tools for your OS. Install.

#### Homebrew

Once you've got CLT installed, jump into your Terminal (Applications » Utilities » Terminal), and copy paste the following:

```bash
ruby <(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)

# Once it's done, add Homebrew's binary path to the front of the $PATH

echo "export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Check to see if everything is configured properly:

```bash
brew doctor
```

To get the latest forumale, run:

```bash
brew update
```

#### Git

Git is an integral component of our workflow. So let's get it STAT. To install, simply run:

```bash
brew install git
```

Once that's done, verify the installation

```bash
git --version
```

Also, running `which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.

#### Ruby

OS X comes with Ruby but that's some system level voodoo you don't want to mess with so we'll be using [rvm](https://rvm.io).

We'll install rvm using Homebrew (it's the best, isn't it?).

```bash
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

When it is done, both RVM and a fresh version of Ruby 2.0 are installed. The following line was also automatically added to your `.bash_profile`.

```bash
[[ -s "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm" ]] && source "$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm"
```

After that, start a new terminal and run:

```bash
type rvm | head -1
```

You should get the output `rvm is a function`. Type in `rvm list`. The one that was just installed, Ruby 2.0, should be set as default.

#### Bundler

Bundler is a nice little dealio that mangages an application's dependencies.

You should be running `Ruby 2.0.0-p247`.

```bash
gem install bundler
```

We need to configure Bundler to install gems relative to our projects instead of globally.

```bash
mkdir ~/.bundle
touch ~/.bundle/config
echo 'BUNDLE_PATH: vendor/bundle' >> ~/.bundle/config
```

Save some time and skip rdoc generation.

```bash
echo 'gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri' >> ~/.gemrc
```

### PostgreSQL

Just like Ruby, OS X Lion and Mountain Lion come with PostgreSQL but it's an old version and no good to develop with.

Let's flex those Homebrew muscles:


```bash
brew install postgresql
initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8

# Add PostgreSQL to launchctl to let OS X manage the process and start when you login
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
```
Postgres has a slightly longer command as you need to pass in the locations so we'll create an alias to shrink all this down to simply `pg`.

```bash
echo "alias pg='pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log'" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
pg start
# Usage: pg {start|stop|restart|reload|status}
```

### Rails

Ah yes. Finally, the main event. As long as you have Ruby and Bundler going, this step should be a cinch.

```bash
gem install rails
```
This might take a little time, so grab your drink of choice and browse the 'net. Once it's done, check you have Rails by running `rails -v`.

_That about does it for the setting up your Mac for Rails development!_

<h1 id="windows"><a href="/set-up#windows">Windows</a></h1>

Currently, not many in the Ruby / Rails community develop on Windows so documentation is sparse or not properly fleshed out.

Here are your choices for Windows:

- Use [Nitrous.io](http://railsapps.github.io/rubyonrails-nitrous-io) (more on this below)
- Install the [Railsbridge Virtual Machine](https://github.com/railsbridge-boston/railsbridge-virtual-machine) or [rails-dev-box](https://github.com/rails/rails-dev-box)
- User [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org) for Windows

Nitrous.io is ideal if you have a fast Internet connection. If not, download the Railsbridge Virtual Machine or rails-dev-box to create a virtual Linux computer with Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.0 using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com). The last option, RailsInstaller, is not recommended because it does not provide an up-to-date version of Ruby or Rails. Also, RVM does not run on Windows.

### Nitrous.io

Nitrous.io is a browser-based development environment. Nitrous.io is free for small projects (like ours!). If you have a fast broadband connection to the Internet, this is your best choice for developing Rails on Windows. And it is a good option if you have any trouble installing Ruby on Mac or Linux because the Nitrous.io hosted environment provides everything you need, including a Unix shell with Ruby and RVM pre-installed, plus a browser-based file manager and text editor. Using a hosted development environment is unconventional but leading developers do so and it may be the wave of the future.

To get started using Nitrous.io, see this article for instructions: [Install Ruby on Rails - Nitrous.io](http://railsapps.github.io/rubyonrails-nitrous-io)
