Introduction
---

We follow several workflows that help us write better and faster code, implement new features, and stay consistent in our style.


Developing a new feature
---

We closely follow the "[GitHub-flow model](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)" of development.

#### Identify missing feature
Start by identifying a missing feature (blog posts, Sunday sermons, photos, etc.) and have a discussion.

- Does it add value to the site?
- Does it communicate something important to the user?
- Does it have a function within the site or is it decoration?
- Does it make the site easier to use?

Be comfortable with saying no. Simpler code is easier to push. If the feature adds value to the site, then it's on to the next step.

#### Create an issue

We use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/tmcyf/tmcyf/issues/new) for issue tracking, creating milestones, prioritizing our focus. Create an issue with a descriptive title and body. Wireframe the feature and refine the idea. Be sure to use the labels provided to make triaging easier.

#### Create a feature branch off of master

Create a descriptively named branch off of the `master` branch. Example: `elasticsearch-implementation`, `redis-transition`, or `retreat-csv-export`.

#### Write feature tests

{ testing }

#### Develop feature and push to named branches constantly

{ develop & commit messages }

#### Open a pull request

{ pull requests }

#### Pull request review and merge to master

{ PR review }

#### Deploy
