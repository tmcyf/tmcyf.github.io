Introduction

We follow several workflows that help us write better and faster code, implement new features, and stay consistent in our style.


Developing a new feature
---

We closely follow the "[GitHub-flow model](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)" of development.

#### Identify missing feature
Start by identifying a missing feature (blog posts, Sunday sermons, photos, etc.) and have a discussion.

- Does it add value to the site?
- Does it communicate something important to the user?
- Does it have a function within the site or is it decoration?
- Does it make the site easier to use?

One of the best ways to feature planning is the user story. User stories are a way to discuss and describe the requirements for a feature. Breaking down the feature's functionality into discrete user stories helps organize the work and track the progress towards completion.

User stories are expressed in the following format:

```html
*Feature*
As a <role>
I want <goal>
In order to <benefit>
```

Here's an example:

```html
*Search*
As a visitor to the website
I want to be able to search for articles, events, and sermons
In order to read devotionals, find events I want to attend, and listen to a message I may have missed
```

Lastly, be comfortable with saying no. Simpler code is easier to push. If the feature adds value to the site, then it's on to the next step.

#### Create an issue

We use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/tmcyf/tmcyf/issues/new) for issue tracking, creating milestones, prioritizing our focus. Create an issue with a descriptive title and in the body, write in the user story along with any pertinent details. Wireframe the feature and refine the idea in the comments. Be sure to use the labels provided to make triaging easier.

#### Create a feature branch off of master

Create a descriptively named branch off of the `master` branch. Example: `elasticsearch-implementation`, `redis-transition`, or `retreat-csv-export`.

#### Write tests

{ testing }

#### Develop feature and push to named branches constantly

{ develop & commit messages }

#### Open a pull request

{ pull requests }

#### Pull request review and merge to master

{ PR review }

#### Deploy
