In a few steps, you can learn how to send emails! HA, as if it's that easy... just kidding. It's that easy.

We use [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/), a bulk email sending service. It lets us design, send, and track emails. It has powerful list management and analytics but those are just bonuses.

*****

### Step 1

Draft an email. Run it through as many officers are possible. Words are important. Even though there may be dozens of people and hamsters on wheels running the YF, it should still sound like we speak in one consistent voice. Be classy, write with empathy, enthusiasm, confidence, patience, and warmth. Respect the reader, act like a human, and use fewer words. It's ok to be funny. I encourage you to peruse the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/16/contents.html) in case you have questions about writing styles.

### Step 2

Navigate over to the login page: [https://login.mailchimp.com](https://login.mailchimp.com/).

Username is `admin@tmcyf.org`. The password will be given to you. Once you login, you'll be prompted to enter the AlterEgo passcode. This is MailChimp's two factor authentication system we use to

1) be safe

2) get mad $$$$discounts$$$$

Go over to [https://alteregoapp.com/login](https://alteregoapp.com/login) and sign in. The username is again, `admin@tmcyf.org` and the password will be given to you. Generate the passcode and copy-paste it into the passcode field back over at MailChimp.

You'll be now taken to the Dashboard! Yay!

### Step 3

The Dashboard has a lot of information so look over those stats and give yourself a minute or two to recover from the shock of finding out the youth members rarely check their emails. Anyway.

On the top left, there's a nice grey button that reads `Create Campaign`. Click on that.

You'll be given options on the type of campaign to send. Be cool and choose `Regular Ol' Campaign`. Now, more options! Choose the list you want to send to.

> Until more people register for the youth fellowship, we will be maintaining two lists. One list is of members who have chosen email as their preferred method of contact. The other is the old list from early 2013. We send to both lists. **Subscribers** will get the regular email while **Combined List** will get the same message but be prompted at the end of every email to register online for the YF.

Select the list and click next.

### Step 4

Fill out all relevant boxes with information. Most of the important fields will be pre-filled but ensure that you have:

- campaign name
- email subject
- from name
- from email address
- merge tags

You can ignore the other tabs like tracking and social media for now.

### Step 5

You will be presented with three options: My Templates, Email Designer, and Predesigned.

Choose `Start Designing` under Email Designer.

On the right side, there're some tabs. Choose `My Campaigns` and you'll be shown previous campaigns. This will basically bring up the previous email for you to edit. Select the previous email and most of the formatting and styles should be intact.

Now you can go and replace all the text with the prepared copy you have from step 1. Don't forget to fill out the email preview field.

After you've completed filling in everything you have, click the `Preview & Test` link up top and select `Enter Preview Mode`. This way, you'll be able to see what the email will look like once it's been sent. If everything is up to the high standards set by your 2013 "webmaster" (lol), click next to continue.

### Step 6

This part is for those people who can't get the nice HTML & CSS portions of the email. Click `Copy Text From HTML Email` and go through to make sure everything made it. Then click next.

### Step 7

Pivotal portion!

This is your chance to review everything. Make sure you've picked the right list, written a good subject line, made sure the HTML and plain text versions of the email look good, and there's a green check next to `Email Authentication`. The `MonkeyRewards` part doesn't have to be green.

Go back up top and click the `Preview & Test` link and choose `Send a Test Email`. Find at least one or two officers to send the test email to. They'll be given a chance to look over the email and reply back with feedback. Take the suggestions, if any, to heart and make the necessary changes. Give it a once over with the preview mode for thoroughness. You're now ready to send!

You can choose to send the email immediately or schedule it to send another time.

### Step 7.2

You should've now sent the email to the main list which is derived from the website. The secondary list named `Combined List` will require a few additional steps.

- In the campaign name, append `-old list` to note the campaign designation.
- You can copy / paste what's written for the old list members. You can find this in the old campaigns so check them out. Please be aware of the formatting.

Once you have written the "note" for the unregistered members and you've felt like you've thoroughly shamed them, complete steps 6 and 7 to send!

### Step 8
Pat yourself on the back and make yourself a nice smoothie. Sit back and watch as your friends and family admire your lvl 100 email sending skills. You deserve it.
